    <h2>Health &amp; Wellness</h2>
    <p>
      Public benefits guides describe medical, dental, vision and mental health
      coverage, with an emphasis on accessibility and predictable out‑of‑pocket
      costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wellness programs and activities can provide additional support and may
      help employees manage healthcare expenses.

    <h2>Retirement &amp; Savings</h2>
    <p>
      For many U.S. employees, JPMorgan Chase offers a 401(k) savings plan with
      matching contributions up to a percentage of eligible pay after a period
      of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some materials also mention automatic company contributions to retirement
      accounts for eligible employees, separate from employee contributions.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Time Off and Other Support</h2>
    <p>
      Summary documents and benefits sites mention paid time off, leave options,
      family and childcare support and other lifestyle benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benefits can vary by country, role and employment status, so employees are
      directed to official internal resources for exact details.
