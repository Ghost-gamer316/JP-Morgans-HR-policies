# JP Morgan HR Policies Website

This is a static multi-page website built with HTML and CSS that presents an educational overview of HR-related themes at JPMorgan Chase, such as diversity & inclusion, employee benefits, and the firm’s code of conduct.

> Student project – this is **not** an official JPMorgan Chase website.

## Features

- **Home page** with a short introduction to the firm’s people, culture and values.
- **Diversity & Inclusion page** summarizing how the company talks about building a diverse, inclusive workforce in its public reports and web pages.
- **Benefits page** with a high-level view of health, wellness, retirement and leave‑related support described in public benefits materials.
- **Code of Conduct page** explaining, in simple language, the purpose of the Code, expected employee behaviour and the idea of “speaking up”.
- **Links page** with direct links to official JPMorgan Chase sites for detailed and up‑to‑date information.
- Clean, responsive layout using modern CSS (no frameworks, no JavaScript).
