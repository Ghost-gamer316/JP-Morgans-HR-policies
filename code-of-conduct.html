    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Code of Conduct describes how employees are expected to act with
      integrity, comply with laws and regulations and protect clients and the
      firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It applies to employees and, in many cases, directors and certain
      contractors associated with the company.
    </p>

    <h2>Workplace Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      The Code states that discrimination, harassment and retaliation are not
      tolerated and that everyone shares responsibility for a professional and
      safe workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It connects with broader policies on equal opportunity and a respectful
      environment for colleagues and clients.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Speaking Up</h2>
    <p>
      Employees are encouraged to report concerns or potential misconduct
      through designated internal channels or hotlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public documents explain that reports made in good faith should be free
      from retaliation, supporting a speak‑up culture.
